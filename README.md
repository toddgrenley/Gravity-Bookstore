### Creating an in-depth query for bookstore inventory management

We build a complex query, step by step, until it is sufficient for our order tracking needs. We analyze the bookstore's database, determine what aspects are needed, add features such as a Calendar Table to better track 
dates, and do some query performance tuning on top of all that.
